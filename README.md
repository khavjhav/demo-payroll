# Earnings Calculator

The Earnings Calculator is a web application that allows users to calculate their monthly earnings, taking into account various factors such as earnings from clients, employee salaries, and miscellaneous costs. The application also provides a summary of monthly profits and allows users to save data for each month.

## Features

- **Clients and Earnings:** Users can input the number of clients they have and specify the earnings for each client. Additionally, users can define the percentage of earnings they receive from each client.

- **Reductions:** Users can input information about their employees, including the number of employees and their salaries. They can also specify miscellaneous costs.

- **Monthly Profit Calculation:** The application calculates the total earnings, total employee salary, total miscellaneous costs, and total reductions. It then calculates the monthly profit by subtracting the total reductions from the total earnings.

- **Monthly Data Storage:** Users can select a month, input data, and save it. The saved data includes total earnings, total employee salary, miscellaneous costs, total reductions, and monthly profit for each month. The data is stored for each month and can be viewed at any time.

- **Salary Calculator (Optional):** Users can calculate the prorated salary of an employee based on their monthly salary, start date, and end date. This feature is helpful for calculating employee salaries based on their joining date.
